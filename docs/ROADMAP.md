# ROADMAP (PLANS FOR THE FUTURE)
This roadmap is a list of additional features and ideas that I want to add. These are goals that I plan to eventually add before I can declare this project a full success.

1. Get a good base threshold value that can be used by other users to get their printer's optimal value.
2. Make a similar project to this that can run as an Octoprint plugin with Marlin.
3. Make an AI that based on the distance and angle of the camera to the print bed, the dimensions of the object, and the layer height can predict a good threshold value after which to cancel the print
> This is a goal that may never be able to happen, but if there is anyone who has experience with making this kind of stuff, it would be great if we could talk, and then I can explain my idea more in depth.
