# Releases
The releases are more of a way to make official separations to be able to tell how the project has evolved over time. I plan on making enough changes to the code to have a new release every 1-3 weeks. 

# Thank you's
Thank you to @droans for the extended_macros repo, and the all the help you gave when I had trouble setting it up.
