# Releases
The releases are more of a way to make official separations to be able to tell how the project has evolved over time. I plan on making enough changes to the code to have a new release every 1-3 weeks. 

After every new release, all branches will be updated to match the master branch. This may cause that branch to be deleted and a new branch with the same name to be created.

# Warning
This repository includes a g-code macro which can potentially damage your printer. Never use a macro unless you understand what it does.

# Thank you's
Thank you to @droans for the extended_macros repo, and the all the help you gave when I had trouble setting it up.
